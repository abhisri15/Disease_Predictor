# Disease Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a certain disease based on user-reported symptoms. The goal is to develop an AI-driven system that aids in preliminary disease prognosis and prompts users to seek medical attention if necessary.

## Project Overview

The project employs machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a specific disease based on reported symptoms. It aims to provide users with an initial understanding of their health status and encourage timely medical consultation.

## Objective

The main objectives of the project are:

- Develop a machine learning model that predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms.
- Build a user-friendly web interface for symptom input and disease prediction.
- Provide accurate and interpretable predictions along with appropriate recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- Python and scikit-learn for machine learning model development.
- Flask for building a web application.
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- NumPy for numerical operations.

## Data Preprocessing

- Analyze and preprocess symptom data.
- Encode categorical features to numerical values.

## AI Model Used

The project employs a machine learning model for disease prediction:

- Random Forest Classifier

## Web Application (app.py)

The project includes a Flask web application that allows users to input their symptoms and receive predictions about the likelihood of a certain disease.

## Model Creation (model.py)

The disease prediction model is created using symptom data, and the Random Forest Classifier is used for modeling.
